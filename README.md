Intro
-----

As mentioned in the capstone project outline, you will be finishing off the movienight project which has been partially completed. This module is about setting up the UI based features.
There are instructions for each question on how you can interact with the site to check that your code is working as intended. However, the best way to verify your work is to run the unit test by clicking the button that says CHECK YOUR WORK. Use the feedback from the unit test to complete each question.
